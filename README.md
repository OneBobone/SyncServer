        <h1>Welcome to the MPS4 Sync Manager</h1>

        <p>
            This application helps you sync playlists from different streaming sources with your Nuvo music server,<br>
            allowing local browsing and playback through the Nuvo and Mirage apps.
        </p>

        <p>Get started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Log in to Spotify on the MPS4 using your preferred browser (Chrome or Edge).</li>
            <li>Install this application. It will install as a service.</li>
            <li>Navigate to this page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Synchronize playlists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the Sync Manager page.</li>
            <li>The playlist table is filled with your playlist library.</li>
            <li>Synchronizing means that changes in e.g. a Spotify.com playlist, becomes up-to-date in the Nuvo system.</li>
            <li>Use the "Sync Now" button to synchronize playlists instantly.</li>
            <li>
                Comments:<br>
                - "Active" => the server subscribes to playlist changes. "Not active" => no subscription to changes.<br>
                - To remove a playlist from your system, you need to remove it from your Spotify.com library AND mark it for removal in the table.<br>
                - Set up a weekly sync schedule using the options on the Sync Manager page.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other Sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playlists from other sources can also be saved on the music server. </li>
            <li>Apple Music playlists are accessed automatically and saved locally in the Spotify format.</li>
            <li>SoundCloud playlists with mp3s are saved locally.</li>
            <li>
                To set-up:<br>
                1) Initialize the other sources in the Settings page. Some sources require installing additional SW.<br>
                2) Select which sources are active in the Sync Manager page.
            </li>
            <li>Comments:<br>
                - Other sources than Spotify, Apple Music and SoundCloud can also be made available.<br>
