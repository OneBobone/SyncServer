allowing local browsing and playback through the **Nuvo** and **Mirage** apps.

- On the MPS4, log in to **Spotify.com** using Chrome.

### Synchronize playlists

- Go to the **Sync Manager** page.  
- The playlist table fills with your playlist library.  
- Synchronizing means that changes in, for example, a Spotify.com playlist become up-to-date in the Nuvo system.  
- Use the **Sync Now** button to synchronize playlists instantly.  

**Comments:**
- **Active** → the server subscribes to playlist changes.  
  **Not active** → no subscription to changes.  
- To remove a playlist from your system, remove it from your Spotify.com library **and** mark it for removal in the table.  
- Set up a weekly sync schedule using the options on the Sync Manager page.

### Other Sources

- Playlists from other sources can also be saved on the music server.  
- **Apple Music** playlists are accessed automatically and saved locally in the Spotify format.  
- **SoundCloud** playlists with MP3s are saved locally.  

**To set up:**
1. Initialize the other sources in the **Settings** page. Some sources require installing additional software.  
2. Select which sources are active in the **Sync Manager** page.

**Comments:**
- Other sources besides Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud can also be supported.
